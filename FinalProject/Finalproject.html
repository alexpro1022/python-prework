            As a child i grew up playing great games like Zelda, mainly Ocarina of Time and Majoras Mask.
        Those 2 games will always have a place in my heart. Nowaday i play WoW, Rocket League, Age of Empires,
        and Valheim.

            I also love riding my motorcycle. I finished getting my motorcycle license last year and the picture above
        is not an R6, but thats the dream. ;)

        I haven't been coding for long, but as far as careers go, i think it fits my personality. I like to 
        build things, and constantly having to learn how to improve your code / new code will keep the job 
        from getting repetitive. I'm trying to finish this course as fast as I can because its time to get 
        out of the basement if you know what i mean!

        I am very much into the paranormal, and conspiracies ;D I would be able to talk anyones ear
        off for a few hours if they asked. I dont mean just ghosts and stuff (great song btw) but, Bigfoot
        and Aliens too. among many many other things. :)
